# Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities via this repository's
[Security tab](https://github.com/Signal-Lynx/sveltekit-saas-starter/security).

This allows us to privately track, fix, and publish the fix before public disclosure.
Please do not publicly disclose potential vulnerabilities until we have had a
reasonable opportunity to investigate and address them.
